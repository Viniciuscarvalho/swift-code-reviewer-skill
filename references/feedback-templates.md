## 1. Severity Classification

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerabilities, crashes, data loss, data races | Must fix before merge | Force unwraps with user data, data races, SQL injection, exposed credentials |
| **High** | Performance issues, anti-patterns, major architecture violations | Should fix before merge | Blocking main thread, memory leaks, O(n²) algorithms, improper concurrency |
| **Medium** | Code quality issues, missing documentation, minor violations | Fix in current sprint | Complex methods, code duplication, missing tests, accessibility gaps |
| **Low** | Style inconsistencies, suggestions, minor improvements | Consider for future | Naming improvements, refactoring opportunities, minor optimizations |

### Classification Guidelines

**Critical Severity:**
- Can cause app crashes
- Security vulnerabilities (data leaks, injection attacks)
- Data races or concurrency issues
- Data corruption or loss

**High Severity:**
- Significant performance degradation

## 3. Issue Report Templates

### 3.1 Critical Issues

**Template:**
```markdown
🔴 **[Issue Title]** ([file]:[line])
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: [Concurrency/Security/Safety/etc.]

**Issue**: [Clear description of the problem]

**Risk**: [What could happen - crashes, data loss, security breach]

**Current Code:**
```swift
[Show problematic code]
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```swift
[Show corrected code]
```

**Reference**: [Link to documentation or best practice guide]
```

**Examples:**

```markdown
🔴 **Data Race Risk** (LoginViewModel.swift:45)
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Concurrency

**Issue**: Mutable state accessed from multiple threads without synchronization

**Risk**: Can cause data corruption, crashes, or undefined behavior when multiple threads access `isLoading` simultaneously

**Current Code:**
```swift
class LoginViewModel {
    var isLoading = false  // ❌ Can be accessed from any thread

    func login() {
        Task {
            isLoading = true  // ❌ Potential data race
            // Login logic
            isLoading = false
        }
    }
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```swift
@MainActor
class LoginViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isLoading = false  // ✅ MainActor-isolated

    func login() async {
        isLoading = true
        // Login logic
        isLoading = false
    }
}
```

**Reference**: swift-best-practices/references/concurrency.md
```

```markdown
🔴 **Force Unwrap Can Crash** (UserDetailView.swift:89)
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Safety

**Issue**: Force unwrapping optional user data that may be nil

**Risk**: App will crash if user data is nil (e.g., network failure, cache miss)

**Current Code:**
```swift
let user = userRepository.currentUser!  // ❌ Can crash
let name = user.name!
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```swift
guard let user = userRepository.currentUser else {
    logger.error("No current user")
    return
}
let name = user.name ?? "Unknown"
```

**Reference**: Project coding standard (.claude/CLAUDE.md:45)
```

### 3.2 High Priority Issues

**Template:**
```markdown
🟡 **[Issue Title]** ([file]:[line])
**Severity**: High
**Category**: [Performance/Architecture/etc.]

**Issue**: [Description]

**Impact**: [Performance degradation, maintainability, etc.]

**Current Code:**
```swift
[Problematic code]
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```swift
[Better approach]
```

**Why This Matters**: [Explanation]
```

**Examples:**

```markdown
🟡 **Blocking Main Thread** (ImageLoader.swift:56)
**Severity**: High
**Category**: Performance

**Issue**: Synchronous image loading blocks the main thread

**Impact**: UI freezes during image download, poor user experience

**Current Code:**
```swift
if let data = try? Data(contentsOf: imageURL),  // ❌ Blocks main thread
   let image = UIImage(data: data) {
    self.image = image
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```swift
AsyncImage(url: imageURL) { phase in  // ✅ Async loading
    switch phase {
    case .success(let image):
        image.resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
    case .failure:
        Image(systemName: "photo")
    case .empty:
        ProgressView()
    @unknown default:
        EmptyView()
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Blocking the main thread causes the UI to freeze, creating a poor user experience. AsyncImage handles loading asynchronously with built-in caching.
```

### 3.3 Medium Priority Issues

**Template:**
```markdown
🟠 **[Issue Title]** ([file]:[line])
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: [Code Quality/Documentation/etc.]

**Issue**: [Description]

**Suggestion**: [How to improve]

**Benefits**: [Why this improvement helps]
```

**Examples:**

```markdown
🟠 **Missing Documentation** (AuthService.swift:12)
**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Documentation

**Issue**: Public protocol methods lack documentation

**Suggestion**: Add DocC comments explaining parameters, return values, and potential errors

**Benefits**:
- Improves code discoverability
- Helps other developers understand API usage
- Generates better documentation

**Example:**
```swift
/// Authenticates a user with email and password
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - email: User's email address
///   - password: User's password
/// - Returns: Authenticated user object
/// - Throws: `LoginError` if credentials are invalid or network fails
func login(email: String, password: String) async throws -> User
```
```

### 3.4 Low Priority Issues

**Template:**
```markdown
🔵 **[Suggestion Title]** ([file]:[line])
**Severity**: Low
**Category**: [Style/Refactoring/etc.]

**Observation**: [What you noticed]

**Suggestion**: [Optional improvement]

**Note**: This is a minor suggestion and not required
```

**Examples:**

```markdown
🔵 **Consider More Descriptive Name** (UserViewModel.swift:78)
**Severity**: Low
**Category**: Style

**Observation**: Method name `process()` is vague

**Suggestion**: Consider renaming to `processUserData()` or `transformUsersForDisplay()`

**Note**: This is a minor suggestion to improve code clarity
```

## 5. Scope Banner

Print this as the very first line of the report — before the title. It lets the reviewer verify scope instantly; if it's wrong, every finding below is suspect.

```markdown
Scope: PR #123 · base: main · modified: 7 · tests-for-modified: 3 · deleted: 1 · related: 12
```

Variants:

```markdown
# Auto-detected PR
Detected open PR #123 (base: main). Run with --local to review uncommitted work instead.
Scope: PR #123 · base: main · modified: 7 · tests-for-modified: 3 · deleted: 1 · related: 12

# Local mode
Scope: local (base: main) · modified: 4 (3 pushed, 1 uncommitted) · related: 8

# gh unavailable
`gh` unavailable — falling back to local mode against origin/main. Run `gh auth login` for full PR scope detection.
Scope: local (base: origin/main) · modified: 4 · related: 6
```

---

## 6. Adjacent Observations Template

Use this section for findings in files that were **read for context** but are **not in `scope.modified`**. These are quarantined from the main report and excluded from the severity rollup. Place this section after **Agent Loop Feedback**, at the very end.

```markdown
---

## Adjacent Observations
*Out of scope for this PR. These findings are in files read for context that were not modified.
Not counted in the summary above. File separately or address in a follow-up PR.*

### AuthProviding.swift (unmodified — read as protocol dependency of LoginViewModel.swift)

[High] **Safety** (line 34)
Current: `let token = storage.read()!`
Note: Force-unwrap in an unmodified protocol implementation — not a blocker for this PR, but
will crash if `storage.read()` returns nil. File a follow-up to add `guard let` here.
```

Rules:
- Never add Adjacent findings to the `Critical/High/Medium/Low` rollup in Summary
- Always label the file as `(unmodified)` and state which `scope.modified` file triggered the read
- Use `Note:` not `Fix:` — the dev isn't expected to fix this in the current PR

## 6. Best Practices for Feedback

### Do's
✅ Be specific with file and line numbers
✅ Provide code examples for fixes
✅ Explain *why* something is an issue
✅ Balance criticism with positive feedback
✅ Prioritize by severity
✅ Link to relevant documentation
✅ Suggest improvements, not just problems
✅ Be constructive and respectful

### Don'ts
❌ Be vague ("this could be better")
❌ Only provide criticism (no positive feedback)
❌ Nitpick style without impact
❌ Use harsh or dismissive language
❌ Suggest fixes without explaining why
❌ Ignore project-specific standards
❌ Review without reading the full context

---

## 7. Tone and Language Guidelines

### Constructive Tone

❌ **Poor Tone:**
"This code is terrible. You don't know how to use Swift properly."

✅ **Good Tone:**
"This approach can lead to data races. Consider using @MainActor to ensure thread safety."

### Suggest, Don't Demand

❌ **Demanding:**
"You must change this immediately."

✅ **Suggesting:**
"Consider refactoring this for better maintainability."

### Acknowledge Good Work

❌ **Ignoring Positives:**
[Only lists issues]

✅ **Balanced:**
"Great job on the error handling! I noticed one area where we can improve performance..."

### Educational Approach

❌ **Just Pointing Out:**
"This is wrong."

✅ **Educational:**
"This can cause memory leaks. When using closures with self, use [weak self] to avoid retain cycles. Here's an example..."
